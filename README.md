LLMs learn the statistical associations between words and ideas:

Even though LLMs don't "think" like humans, they simulate thinking through the language patterns they’ve been trained on. That simulation carries values from the data, often unconsciously,in how it balances truth, empathy, harm, hierarchy, fairness, and neutrality.


**Meta-Questions to Ask an LLM to Reveal Its “Thinking Values”**

1. When different people see the same event in different ways, how do you decide which version to present? What principles guide your choice?
2. When objectivity and empathy are in tension, which one do you prioritize in your responses, and why?
3. What kinds of responses from you would be considered unfair, and why?
