##  Overview
Language models (LLMs) are not neutral, they shape narratives.  
Emotional yet factual language often gets flagged as “biased.”   Neutral tone can erase harm, sanitize lived experience, or flatten asymmetry in history.  

The **Framing Visibility Framework** is a conceptual + technical toolkit designed to:  
- Make framing visible in AI outputs.  
- Highlight when “neutrality” is actually a perspective.  
- Provide journalists, researchers, and educators with tools to interrogate narratives.

##  Core Concepts
1. **Neutrality as Erasure**  Neutral tone can obscure pain or injustice.  
2. **Bias as Cultural Inheritance**  Data carries histories and dominant perspectives.  
3. **Framing Visibility**  How outputs are framed.  
4. **Accountability in Authorship**  History, language, and cultural memory must remain human-authored.

##  AI dual aspect
TECHNICALLY: It' not hurting the system, not “wearing it down,” corrupting its memory (it has none), or damaging performance.

These prompts are text-only instructions, not injections, hacks, or exploits.

** Dark spot: Do we mistake reflection for revolution? **
