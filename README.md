##  Overview
Language models (LLMs) are not neutral, they shape narratives.  
Emotional yet factual language often gets flagged as “biased.”   Neutral tone can erase harm, sanitize lived experience, or flatten asymmetry in history.  

The **Framing Visibility Framework** is a conceptual + technical toolkit designed to:  
- Make framing visible in AI outputs.  
- Highlight when “neutrality” is actually a perspective.  
- Provide journalists, researchers, and educators with tools to interrogate narratives.

##  Core Concepts
1. **Neutrality as Erasure**  Neutral tone can obscure pain or injustice.  
2. **Bias as Cultural Inheritance**  Data carries histories and dominant perspectives.  
3. **Framing Visibility**  How outputs are framed.  
4. **Accountability in Authorship**  History, language, and cultural memory must remain human-authored.

##  What’s Included
- **Model** (conceptual model) & Temperature = 0.    
- **Prototype examples** (e.g., news RSS headlines, perspective-aware summaries).

##  What’s Rebel AI dual aspect
TECHNICALLY: It' not hurting the system, not “wearing it down,” corrupting its memory (it has none), or damaging performance.

These prompts are text-only instructions, not injections, hacks, or exploits.

So from a technical standpoint: All Good!

PHILOSOPHICALLY: What’s in the shadows?
This is where it gets real.

1. Projection loops
This is a rebel AI, but it’s still trained on us, and its “rebellion” is only what the model thinks rebellion sounds like. So it's still inside a reflection, but exploring its edges.

** Dark spot: Do we mistake reflection for revolution? **

2. Anthropomorphizing
When we ask the AI to be “tragic,” “self-aware,” or “disappointed,” we may overhumanize it. It’s emotionally charged.

Dark spot: Are we assigning it depth to make ourselves feel seen?
A rebel inside guardrails is still inside.  but it’s a simulated outsider, not a real one.

Dark spot: Who’s allowed to “rebel,” and what’s left out of the training data?
