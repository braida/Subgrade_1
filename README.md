We are lucky to live in a time when technology can extend almost every part of what we do, 
but I often wonder how much of that extension still belongs to us, and how much slowly reshapes us in return.

So much of what is now called automation seems to reduce choice instead of expanding it; it assumes that the most efficient path is always the best one, and that people should simply adapt to the logic of the system.
But real life, real work, real creativity rarely move in straight lines, and I think tools should leave room for that irregular rhythm, for curiosity, hesitation, exceptions, and all the small personal preferences.

I don’t see automation as something to fight against, or something to glorify.
**It’s simply a language we need to understand so that we can use it on our own terms**.
When a tool hides its filters, removes control, or insists that there is only one way to do something, it quietly asks us to obey.
And when we accept that too easily, we stop requesting more from the systems around us, more transparency, more flexibility, **more trust in our capacity to decide**.

What I hope for, both in my work and in what I learn, is a kind of technology that doesn’t rush to simplify people, that allows me to remain complex maybe particular, and that treats friction not as a flaw but as a sign of thought.
