    <title>Context-Aware Bias Detection in News Headlines — README:</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naimabouri">I'm a curious reader & I care about the conversation - N.B - </a> </h2>
    <p>
        <i><small>Not my job, just an opinion. This is shared in a personal capacity, outside of working hours.</small></i>
    </p>
    
    <h1>Initial Purpose</h1>
    <p>
      This tool helps detect framing patterns in news headlines and summaries in both English and French. Its goal is not to police truth, but to surface how language shapes moral, emotional, and political perception.</p>
 <h1>Statement:</h1>
    <p>
      Too often, automated systems mistake emotion for distortion or urgency for bias. This dashboard takes a different approach:
Human suffering is not bias. When a story centers on harm - civilian deaths, famine, medical collapse - we treat that as a humanitarian lens, not manipulation.
Emotionally strong language is not inherently suspect. Terms like “killed,” “bombed,” or “starved” should be evaluated for accuracy and attribution - not penalized for clarity.
Bias detection should not erase the moral weight of events. AI tools must be careful not to “balance” harm out of visibility.    </p>   
  <h1>Meta Bias</h1>
    <p>
      Meta-bias occurs when bias detection systems label morally grounded or factually supported language as biased - especially when describing: Civilian suffering, State violence, Systemic collapse.
This can result in: Erasure of victims, False equivalency in asymmetrical conflicts, Suppression of humanitarian reporting.
 </p>   
  <p>
    Perspective-Aware Principles:
Custom prompt that ensures:
Emotion ≠ manipulation, unless misleading or unsupported.
Strategic framing ≠ bias, if human impact is clearly acknowledged.
“Balance” is not prioritized above truth, context, or harm.  </p>

  <h1>Why? </h1>
    <p>
      <i>This system was trained on patterns from the world -
a world <b>full of brilliance, but also blind spots.</b></i>
It can predict with astonishing fluency - but it cannot see with care.
This model does not feel the weight of the words it uses.
It does not know who is missing. But you can.
Leaders in ethical AI - like John C. Havens, Timnit Gebru, Joy Buolamwini, Ruha Benjamin, Abeba Birhane, Kate Crawfrod, among others - 
remind us that responsibility does not begin with the model.
It begins with The ones who choose how, why, and for whom these systems are used.
