    <title>Context-Aware Bias Detection in News Headlines — README:</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naimabouri">I'm a curious reader & care about the conversation (This is shared in a personal capacity, outside of working hours.) - N.B - </a> </h1>
    
    
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      This project aims to develop a language model-based assistant that evaluates news-related text (headlines and summaries) for ideological bias framing — with a specific focus on ethical and contextual grounding.
      Unlike many bias detection systems that rely on surface-level cues (e.g., emotionally charged words), this model is designed to understand the difference between manipulative framing and the accurate reporting of human suffering.
    </p>
  
 <h1>Statement:</h1>
    <p>
      Traditional bias detection in large language models (LLMs) often:
Flags emotionally charged but factually valid language (e.g., "killed", "attack") as biased,
Fails to account for source attribution and power asymmetries,
Misclassifies victim-centered or morally clear reporting as ideologically slanted,
Prioritizes a false neutrality that can erase human consequences or protect dominant narratives.
    </p>   

  <h1>Approach used here:</h1>
    <p>
      This system is designed to:
Detect bias framing, not factual correctness or political alignment,
Evaluate the structure, balance, attribution, and tone of the text,
Differentiate between:
Emotion that reflects truthful, ethical journalism,
Emotion used to manipulate perception or obscure facts.
    </p>   
  <p>
    Key principles:
Emotional impact ≠ bias (when fact-based or properly attributed),
Moral weight matters — acknowledging suffering is not framing,
Balance must be assessed holistically (what is said, how, and by whom).
  </p>

  <h1>Why? </h1>
    <p>
      <i>LLMs may misclassify emotionally charged language as biased, raising the question of whether — and how — it is possible to frame “fair narratives” in emotionally complex contexts.</i>
As AI plays a growing role in information filtering, it is essential that systems recognize the difference between:
Manipulative framing, and
Honest, ethically necessary reporting — even when it’s emotionally uncomfortable.

    <h2>Why Fair Narratives Matter</h2>
    <p>
        Fair and balanced narratives shape how societies understand truth, empathy, and responsibility. 
        Policies promoting accurate and inclusive storytelling can reduce bias, improve trust in institutions, 
        and empower communities to engage in constructive dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>According to UNESCO’s <em>Global Media and Information Literacy</em> framework, fostering critical thinking 
        and equitable representation in media is essential for informed decision-making and protecting democratic values.
    </p>
    <p>
        By improving the lens through which readers view the world, we create space for compassion, innovation, 
        and collective progress.
