    <title>Context-Aware Bias Detection in News Headlines — README:</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      This project aims to develop a language model-based assistant that evaluates news-related text (headlines and summaries) for ideological bias framing — with a specific focus on ethical and contextual grounding.
      Unlike many bias detection systems that rely on surface-level cues (e.g., emotionally charged words), this model is designed to understand the difference between manipulative framing and the accurate reporting of human suffering.
    </p>
  
 <h1>Statement</h1>
    <p>
      Traditional bias detection in large language models (LLMs) often:
Flagms emotionally charged but factually valid language (e.g., "killed", "attack") as biased,
Fails to account for source attribution and power asymmetries,
Misclassifies victim-centered or morally clear reporting as ideologically slanted,
Prioritizes a false neutrality that can erase human consequences or protect dominant narratives
    </p>   

  <h1>Approach used here</h1>
    <p>
      This system is designed to:
Detect bias framing, not factual correctness or political alignment,
Evaluate the structure, balance, attribution, and tone of the text,
Differentiate between:
Emotion that reflects truthful, ethical journalism,
Emotion used to manipulate perception or obscure facts.
    </p>   
  <p>
    Key principles:
Emotional impact ≠ bias (when fact-based or properly attributed),
Moral weight matters — acknowledging suffering is not framing,
Balance must be assessed holistically (what is said, how, and by whom).
  </p>

  <h1>Why? </h1>
    <p>
      <i>LLMs may misclassify emotionally charged language as biased, raising the question of whether — and how — it is possible to frame “fair narratives” in emotionally complex contexts.</i>
As AI plays a growing role in information filtering, it is essential that systems recognize the difference between:
Manipulative framing, and
Honest, ethically necessary reporting — even when it’s emotionally uncomfortable.
